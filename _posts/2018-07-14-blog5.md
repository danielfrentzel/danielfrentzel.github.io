title: Dynamic Virtual Tour of Crested Butte

This project consists of a Flask website running off of an Sqlite server. Pins are added making locations and pictures can be uploaded at pin locations. Everything is stored and loaded into the database so users can add and view locations on the virtual tour.

More information will be added soon.
