title: Dynamic Virtual Tour of Crested Butte
---

This project consists of a Flask website running off of an Sqlite server. The tour consists of pins on a map to mark locations and pictures that are uploaded corresponding to the pin. Pins have already been placed on the tour so users can visit and interact with the <a href="http://danielfrentzel.pythonanywhere.com/">website</a>. Everything is stored in a database and dynamically loaded so users can add their locations and pictures to the virtual tour.

Information on how to use the website and understand the underlying technologies can be found in the documentaton link below.
