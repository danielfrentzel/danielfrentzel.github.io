title: Hand build 20x10 LED display with Tetris
---

<img src="https://danielfrentzel.github.io/static/display_small.png" alt="display1">

Classmate and I hand wired a 200 LED display to run off of a Raspberry Pi or Arduino and wrote a Tetris program to be played on the display.

More information will be added about this project soon.
