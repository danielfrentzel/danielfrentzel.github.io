title: Hand build 20x10 LED display with Tetris
---

As part of an embedded systems class, we were instructed to create a project powered by an Arduino or Raspberry Pi, using various electrcal components, to display competence in the class material. A classmate, Brendan, and I decided to create a display using individual LEDs with the goal to implement a game of Tetris. In order to power the classical 10x20 Tetris display, we needed a way to wire and control 200 LEDs with less than 30 general-purpose input/output, GPIO, pins on the Raspberry Pi. Little did we know that the final project would employ 4 breadboards and 500 hand cut wires.

<h2>Project Design</h2>
After discussing ideas we realized that by connecting LEDs across the rows and LEDs down the columns together, that a coordinate-like system could be acheived. Since LEDs need a voltage differential to flow, by supplying 0v to column, x, and 5v to row, y, the LED at coordinate x, y can be illuminated. This method works great as long as only a single LED is illuminated at a time. A list of LEDs that need to be illuminated will be iterated through, flashing every LED on, then off, to appear as multiple LEDs are on at the same time. This idea alone only requires 30 GPIO pins, but we still need to reduce that number.

<h3>Demultiplexers</h3>
Our professor, Andy Keck, introducted the idea of multiplexer chips. Demultiplexers can be used to take n, number of inputs, to power 2<sup>n</sup> output chips. Using demultiplexers allow us to use only 5 GPIO pins to control the 20 rows and 4 pins to account for the 10 columns.
