title: Song Year Prediction on the Million Song Dataset
---

The sound of music has changed throughout the past century and continues
to change. The Million Song Dataset has collected song features from popular
contemporary songs ranging from 1922 to 2010. By using the sound charac-
teristics of songs, this project applies linear regression models, namely ordinary
least squares and ridge regression, to the segments pitches and segments timbre
features found in the dataset. These features are used to build a model matrix
of predictors and to predict song release years using residual sum of squares
and leave-one-out cross-validation. 

<h2>Technologies</h2>
The project is programmed in python using various libraries. NumPy is used to store data in narrays, compute covariance matricies for song data and for general computing. Pandas is used to create dataframe structures for analysis, which are pickled as fast, serialized files that could easily be reloaded. Scikit-learn did the heavy lifting by supplying the machine learning models while Matplotlib graphs the results.
