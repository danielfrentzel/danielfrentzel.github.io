title: Hand build 20x10 LED display with Tetris
---

As part of an embedded systems class, we were instructed to create a project powered by an Arduino or Raspberry Pi, using various electrcal components, to display competence in the class material. A classmate, Brendan, and I decided to create a display using individual LEDs with the goal to implement a game of Tetris. In order to power the classical 10x20 Tetris display, we needed a way to wire and control 200 LEDs with less than 30 general-purpose input/output, GPIO, pins on the Raspberry Pi. Little did we know that the final project would employ 4 breadboards and around 500 hand cut wires.

<h2>Project Design</h2>
After discussing ideas we realized that by connecting LEDs across the rows and LEDs down the columns together, that a coordinate-like system could be acheived. Since LEDs need a voltage differential to flow, by supplying 0v to column, x, and 5v to row, y, the LED at coordinate x, y can be illuminated. This method works great as long as only a single LED is illuminated at a time. A list of LEDs that need to be illuminated will be iterated through, flashing every LED on, then off, to appear as multiple LEDs are on at the same time. This idea alone only requires 30 GPIO pins, but we still need to reduce that number.

<h3>Demultiplexers</h3>
Our professor, Dr. Andy Keck, introducted the idea of multiplexer chips. Demultiplexers can be used to take n, number of inputs, to power 2<sup>n</sup> output chips. Using demultiplexers allows us to use 5 GPIO pins to control the 20 rows and 4 pins to account for the 10 columns. Due to how to board is setup, we chose to use 5 pins to control the columns to prevent the first led from defaulting to the on position while keeping zero based indexing. Ultimately, this reduced the number of required GPIO pins from 30 to only 10.

<h4>Getting It Done</h4>
As it turns out, 5 to 32 pin demultiplexers are not readilly available, but a 2 to 4 along with three 3 to 8 demultiplexers can be used together to acheive 32 output pins. This is acheived by using the highest two binary inputs to supply the 2 to 4 chip to enable a single 3 to 8 chip, while the lowest three binary inputs supply input to every 3 to 8 chip. Below, on the left, is a diagram of how to columns are controlled with one 2 to 4 chip and two 3 to 8 chips. The same logic is used for the rows. It is also worth mentioning that the used demultiplexers send low to the selected output pin and high to the rest. While this is ideal for controlling the columns, it means that the demultiplexer outputs going to the 3 to 8 chips and to the rows need to be inverted.

<h3>LED Wiring</h3>
In order to connect the rows and columns in series, a lot of individual wires needed to be cut. Luckily, we were able to plug in 2x3 grids of LEDs to share appropiate power and grounds. Wires were then cut to jump each grid to connect the whole display, as shown above on the right. A dense forest of wires is hidden underneath the LEDs.
