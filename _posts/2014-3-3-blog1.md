title: Project Euler Problem 2
---

The Fibinici sequence is renowned for its golden ratio that is found throughout our world. It starts with the first two terms as 1 and is formed with each subsequent term being the sum of the two previous terms (1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...). Suppose one wanted to know the sum of every term less than 4 million. While the solution is straight forward, a little cleverness can be used to improve efficiency. 

```python
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```
