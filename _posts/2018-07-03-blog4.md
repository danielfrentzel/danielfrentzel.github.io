title: Boids Flocking Simulation
---

This project consisted of independant bodies acting on certain characteristics to simulate the nature of a flying flock of birds. Boids, buildings and a world are created and the boids have three desires; avoid collisions with other boids and buildings, fly in the same direction of other nearby boids and to stay towards the center of the flock.

More information about this project, the technologies used and which part of the development I was apart of will be added soon.
