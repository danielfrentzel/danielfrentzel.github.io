title: Boids Flocking Simulation
---

This project consisted of independent bodies, boids, acting on certain characteristics to simulate the nature of a flying flock of birds. A world was created and boids were given three desires to fly based on Craig W. Reynolds paper, "Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavior Model."

 <ol>
  <li>Collision Avoidance</li>
    <ul>The disire to avoid collisions with nearby boids</ul>
  <li>Velocity Matching</li>
    <ul>The disire to fly at the same speed as nearby boids</ul>
  <li>Flock Centering</li>
    <ul>The disire to stay towards the center of the flock</ul>
</ol>
