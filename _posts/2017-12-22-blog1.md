title: Sum of Even Fibinici Terms
---

The Fibinici sequence is renowned for its golden ratio that is found throughout our world. It starts with the first two terms as 1 and is formed with each subsequent term being the sum of the two previous terms (1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...). Suppose one wanted to know the sum of every even term less than 4 million. While the solution is straight forward, a little cleverness can be used to improve efficiency. 


Since the first two terms of the sequence are given, we can start the sequence as a list and build the rest of the terms less than 4 million
```python
f = [1, 1]

while f[-1] + f[-2] < 4000000:
    f.append(f[-2] + f[-1])  # add the next term, the sum of the previous two terms
```
At this point our list, f, holds all the Fibinici terms less than 4 million. Finding the sum of the even terms is easy enough. I used a comprehension to get the even terms and the built in sum operator
```python
print(sum([val for val in f if val % 2 == 0]))
```
We have answered the question, but do we really need to append each term and hold onto the entire sequence? After all, we are just summing the even terms. 

Let's try to do this on the fly by only holding two values at a time. When we compute the next term, we will replace the held values.

Notice, since we aren't holding the sequence, we can't use the sum operator.

```python
f = [1, 1]
sum2 = 0

while f[0] + f[1] < 4000000:
    f[0], f[1] = f[1], f[0] + f[1] 
    if f[1] % 2 == 0:
        sum2 += f[1]

print(sum2)
```
Notice the subtlety
